            <h2>Welcome to STARS@SLU</h2>
<h3>Curious about data? Want to try research? No experience needed!</h3>
<p>
STARS@SLU is a free two-week summer program for high school juniors and seniors in the St. Louis area. You will learn to work with real data using R, a programming language, while exploring 
    datasets on topics you care about, from St. Louis Open Data to national databases. Working in small teams with support from SLU faculty and student mentors, you will investigate questions 
    that interest you, analyze what you find, and present your results at the end of the program during the poster session. 
    Throughout the program, you will solve problems through math games and puzzles, hear from professionals in different fields, and connect with other students who are curious about STEM.

  <blockquote>
    <p>“The most valuable experience for me was meeting new people and forming connections more quickly than I ever have before. 
        I never expected to open up so easily with Dr. Uğurlu, Dr. Clair, Dr. Gilbert, the amazing mentors who generously donated their time, 
        and everyone who came to the poster project. Even Preet Kaur, who was only there during the second week, connected with us quickly and helped build a strong team. 
        I felt incredibly supported every day by all involved, which made the entire experience one-of-a-kind.”</p>
