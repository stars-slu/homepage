            STARS@SLU provides high school juniors and seniors from underrepresented groups with hands-on experience in statistics and data analysis using R.
                In this program, students will explore real-world datasets from sources like St. Louis Open Data and Data is Plural, conducting research on topics of their interest.
                By integrating research, mentorship, and exposure to different mathematical concepts and their applications, through presentations by invited speakers,
                STARS@SLU offers a unique opportunity to strengthen studentsâ€™ confidence and engagement in mathematics.
                The program aims to expand equitable access to mathematical research and encourage and equip more students from diverse backgrounds to pursue STEM fields.
