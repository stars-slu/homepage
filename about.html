            <h2>About STARS@SLU</h2>
            <p> In this program, students will learn how to use R for data analysis, work on team research projects with real-world datasets, and present their findings at a
                poster session. The program also includes mentoring, guest speaker talks, and sessions about college life and STEM careers.
